# Enterprise CLI ATDD Test Coverage Report

## Issue #56 Requirements Coverage

This document maps each requirement from Issue #56 to the corresponding ATDD test scenarios.

### 1. CLI Standards Compliance ✓

**Requirement**: Add missing CLI standards: --quiet, --no-color, --output

**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Standards_Compliance`
- ✓ Validates --quiet flag suppresses output

- ✓ Validates global flags appear in help output

### 2. Command Organization ✓

**Requirement**: Better command organization (group related commands)

**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Command_Organization`
- ✓ Verifies commands are grouped logically (e.g., "manage" group)
- ✓ Tests that help shows organized command structure
- ✓ Verifies subcommand organization
- ✓ Tests group descriptions are clear

### 3. Error Handling & Validation ✓

**Requirement**: Improved error handling & validation

**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Error_Handling`
- ✓ Tests improved validation with cobra.ExactArgs
- ✓ Verifies graceful error messages
- ✓ Tests error propagation through command chain
- ✓ Validates pre-execution validation
- ✓ Tests consistent error formatting

### 4. Shell Completion Support ✓

**Requirement**: Shell completion support

**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Shell_Completion`
- ✓ Verifies completion command exists
- ✓ Tests bash completion generation
- ✓ Tests zsh completion generation
- ✓ Tests fish completion generation
- ✓ Verifies context-aware completion
- ✓ Tests custom completion functions

### 5. Interactive Mode ✓

**Requirement**: Interactive mode for complex commands

**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Interactive_Mode`
- ✓ Tests interactive prompt support
- ✓ Verifies complex commands have interactive alternatives
- ✓ Tests validation in interactive mode
- ✓ Validates smooth user experience
- ✓ Tests that interactive mode is optional

### 6. Progressive Disclosure ✓

**Requirement**: Progressive disclosure for advanced flags

**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Progressive_Disclosure`
- ✓ Tests --advanced flag reveals additional options
- ✓ Verifies basic usage hides complex features
- ✓ Tests adaptive help based on user level
- ✓ Validates layered documentation
- ✓ Tests manageable learning curve

### 7. Enterprise Positioning ✓

**Requirement**: Position as enterprise solution

**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Enterprise_Positioning`
- ✓ Verifies complexity indicators show 7/10
- ✓ Tests handling of 10+ commands
- ✓ Verifies robust configuration management
- ✓ Tests scalable architecture
- ✓ Validates professional patterns

## Additional Test Coverage

### Configuration Management
**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Configuration_Management`
- Multiple configuration sources (files, env, flags)
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secure secrets handling
- Comprehensive validation
- Hot reloading support

### Logging Standards
**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Logging_Standards`
- Structured logging formats
- Configurable log levels
- Integration with --quiet flag
- Integration with --no-color flag
- Multiple output format support

### Build & Performance
**Test Scenario**: `TestEnterprise_CLI_Build_Performance`
- Efficient compilation
- Reasonable binary size
- Fast startup time
- Memory optimization
- Command scalability

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **RED Phase** (Current State)
   - All tests will FAIL initially since implementation hasn't started
   - This validates our test coverage is comprehensive

2. **GREEN Phase** (Implementation)
   - Implement each feature to make tests pass
   - Focus on minimal implementation to satisfy tests

3. **REFACTOR Phase** (Optimization)
   - Improve code quality while keeping tests green
   - Add performance optimizations
   - Enhance user experience

## Validation Methods

The tests use helper validation methods that check:
- File existence and content
- Directory structure
- Code patterns and practices
- Compilation success
- Runtime behavior
- Performance metrics

## Test Helpers

All tests leverage the existing test framework:
- `helpers.GenerateProject()` - Generates test projects
- `helpers.AssertFileContains()` - Validates file content
- `helpers.AssertProjectCompiles()` - Ensures compilation
- Custom validators for enterprise-specific features

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all enterprise CLI tests
go test -v ./tests/acceptance/blueprints/cli/enterprise_test.go

# Run specific test scenario
go test -v -run TestEnterprise_CLI_Standards_Compliance ./tests/acceptance/blueprints/cli/

# Run with coverage
go test -v -cover ./tests/acceptance/blueprints/cli/
```

## Expected Test Results

### Before Implementation (RED)
- All tests should FAIL
- Error messages indicate missing features
- This confirms tests are properly detecting absence

### After Implementation (GREEN)
- All tests should PASS
- Generated projects compile successfully
- All features work as specified

## Notes

- Tests follow BDD/Gherkin style with Given/When/Then structure
- Each test is independent and can run in isolation
- Tests use real blueprint generation, not mocks
- Performance tests have reasonable thresholds for CI/CD
