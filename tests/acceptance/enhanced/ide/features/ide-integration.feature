Feature: IDE Integration for Real-time Optimization
  As a Go developer using modern IDEs
  I want real-time optimization suggestions and validation integrated into my development environment
  So that I can optimize my code as I write it and maintain high code quality continuously

  Background:
    Given I have the go-starter CLI available
    And all templates are properly initialized
    And the optimization system is available
    And IDE integration infrastructure is enabled

  @ide-integration @real-time @critical
  Scenario: Real-time optimization suggestions in code editor
    Given I have a Go project open in my IDE
    When I write code that could benefit from optimization:
      | code_pattern                    | optimization_suggestion              | suggestion_priority | fix_preview           |
      | unused import "debug/pprof"     | Remove unused debug import           | high               | // import removed     |
      | for i := 0; i < len(items)      | Cache len(items) for performance     | medium             | n := len(items)       |
      | strings concatenation in loop   | Use strings.Builder for efficiency  | high               | var b strings.Builder |
      | if err != nil { return err }    | Consolidate error handling           | medium             | consolidated pattern  |
      | nested if depth > 3             | Extract to helper function           | high               | extracted function    |
      | magic number 404                | Extract to named constant            | low                | const NotFound = 404  |
    Then I should see real-time optimization suggestions as I type
    And suggestions should appear with appropriate priority indicators
    And each suggestion should show a preview of the optimized code
    And I should be able to apply suggestions with a single click
    And suggestions should update automatically as code changes

    And validation should provide actionable improvement suggestions
    And false positives should be minimized through context analysis
