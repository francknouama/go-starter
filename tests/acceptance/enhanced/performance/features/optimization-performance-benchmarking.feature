    When I run comprehensive performance benchmarks with optimization
    Then I should collect detailed performance metrics:
      | metric_category        | measurement_points                         | analysis_depth    |
      | Compilation Time       | before/after optimization, delta          | statistical      |

  @enhanced @performance @impact-analysis @metrics
  Scenario: Detailed optimization impact analysis per blueprint category
    Given I have baseline performance metrics for each blueprint category
    When I apply optimization and measure performance impact:
      | blueprint_category | optimization_areas              | expected_impact           | measurement_criteria      |
      | Simple Projects    | import cleanup, formatting      | 5-15% improvement        | compile time, file size   |

      | Enterprise Projects| deep optimization, patterns     | 30-50% improvement       | all metrics combined      |
    Then impact analysis should show measurable improvements
    And improvements should correlate with project complexity
    And optimization ROI should be quantifiable per category
    And performance gains should justify optimization overhead

  @enhanced @performance @compilation @benchmarking
  Scenario: Compilation performance benchmarking with optimization levels
    Given I have projects representing different compilation complexities
    When I benchmark compilation performance across optimization levels:

    Then compilation benchmarks should show optimization effectiveness
    And performance improvements should scale with optimization level
    And compilation time reduction should be consistent and measurable
    And no compilation failures should occur at any optimization level

  @enhanced @performance @memory @profiling
  Scenario: Memory usage profiling during optimization process
    Given I have memory profiling infrastructure enabled
    When I profile memory usage during optimization of different blueprints:
      | blueprint_type | project_size | optimization_memory_budget | peak_usage_expected |
      | cli-simple     | small       | 50-100MB                  | 60-80MB            |

    Then memory usage should stay within defined budgets
    And memory should be efficiently released after optimization
    And no memory leaks should be detected during profiling
    And memory usage should scale predictably with project size
