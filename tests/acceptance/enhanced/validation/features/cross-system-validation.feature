Feature: Cross-System Validation and Regression Testing
  As a Go developer using go-starter's comprehensive enhanced system
  I want all systems to work together seamlessly without conflicts or regressions
  So that I can trust the reliability and stability of the entire enhanced platform

  Background:
    Given I have the go-starter CLI available
    And all templates are properly initialized
    And the optimization system is available
    And the quality analysis system is available
    And the performance monitoring system is available
    And the matrix testing system is available
    And all enhanced systems are operational

  @integration @cross-system @validation
  Scenario: Complete system integration validation
    Given I have a comprehensive test matrix covering all system combinations:
      | system_combination                    | validation_priority | expected_interactions     |
      | Matrix + Optimization                | critical           | Blueprint optimization    |
      | Performance + Quality                | critical           | Quality-performance balance|
      | Architecture + Database              | high               | Architecture-aware DB ops |
      | Framework + Authentication          | high               | Framework-specific auth   |
      | CLI + Platform                      | medium             | Cross-platform CLI        |
      | Enterprise + Workspace              | medium             | Enterprise workspace      |
    When I execute the complete integration test suite
    Then all system combinations should pass validation
    And no conflicts should be detected between systems
    And all integration points should function correctly
    And system boundaries should be properly maintained

  @regression @cross-system @stability
  Scenario: Comprehensive regression testing across all enhanced systems
    Given I have established baselines for all enhanced systems:
      | system_area          | baseline_metrics                    | regression_thresholds        |
      | Matrix Testing       | 300+ combinations, 95% success     | >90% success, <10% variance |
      | Optimization         | 15 optimization types, 85% quality | >80% quality, <15% time     |

      | Authentication       | 5 auth types, 98% validation      | >95% validation success     |
      | Platform Support     | 3 platforms, 95% consistency      | >90% cross-platform success |
      | CLI Functionality    | 2 complexity levels, 100% build   | 100% compilation success    |

      | Workspace Management | Multi-module, 95% coordination    | >90% coordination success   |
    When I run regression tests against current implementation
    Then no system should show performance degradation beyond thresholds
    And all baseline functionality should be preserved
    And new enhancements should not break existing features
    And system reliability metrics should meet or exceed baselines

  @integration @system-boundaries @isolation
  Scenario: System boundary validation and isolation testing
    Given I have systems with clearly defined boundaries and interfaces

    And interface contracts should be honored by all systems
    And data flow should follow established patterns

  @performance @cross-system @scalability
  Scenario: Cross-system performance and scalability validation
    Given I have performance benchmarks for individual systems

      | operation_type                        | individual_baseline | integrated_target    | scalability_factor |
      | Matrix generation with optimization   | 5s per project     | 6-8s per project    | 1.2-1.6x overhead  |

    And resource contention should be minimized

  @data-flow @integration @consistency
  Scenario: Data flow and consistency validation across systems
    Given I have established data flow patterns between systems
    When I trace data flow through complete system integration
    Then data should flow consistently through all integration points:
