# GitHub Issues to Close

Based on review of the current codebase and recent commits, the following GitHub issues appear to have been addressed and can be closed:

## Issues Related to ClickHouse Implementation

### Issue #141: docs: Add comprehensive ClickHouse database documentation
**Status: Can be closed as "Won't Do" or "Not Planned"**
**Reason:** 
- ClickHouse is not listed in the implemented blueprints
- Current database support includes PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, and Redis
- No ClickHouse-related code or templates exist in the codebase
- This appears to be a future enhancement that hasn't been prioritized

### Issue #140: feat: Implement ClickHouse database blueprint templates
**Status: Can be closed as "Won't Do" or "Not Planned"**
**Reason:** 
- Same as above - ClickHouse implementation has not been started
- The project currently supports 5 database types successfully
- This would be part of a future release if prioritized

## Issues Related to Security Implementation

### Issue #34: Security Testing and Validation Framework
**Status: Can be closed as "Completed"**
**Reason:**
- ✅ **Template Security Validation**: Fully implemented in `internal/security/template.go`
  - Template injection prevention with dangerous pattern detection
  - Function whitelisting (safe Sprig functions only)
  - Path traversal protection, resource limits, comprehensive scanning
- ✅ **Input Validation Security**: Fully implemented in `internal/security/input.go`
  - Path traversal prevention, module path validation, project name sanitization
  - Resource limit enforcement, variable name sanitization, XSS prevention
- ✅ **Security Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite in `tests/security/`
  - Template injection tests, input sanitization tests, path traversal tests
  - Resource exhaustion tests, security violation scanning tests
- ✅ **CLI Security Tools**: Implemented in `cmd/security.go`
  - Blueprint security scanning, configuration validation, multiple output formats
- ✅ **CI/CD Security Integration**: Automated security scanning in GitHub Actions
  - Daily security scans, govulncheck, gosec, dependency review, template validation
- ✅ **Security Documentation**: Complete security policy in `SECURITY.md`
  - Threat model, reporting process, security best practices
- **Assessment**: All major security requirements from the original issue have been implemented

## Likely Resolved Issues (Based on Implemented Features)

Since I only see the two ClickHouse-related issues in the current output, here are features that have been implemented based on the codebase review, which likely had corresponding issues that can be closed:

### Logger System Implementation
- The logger selector system is fully implemented with support for slog, zap, logrus, and zerolog
- All logger templates are working and tested
- Integration with all blueprints is complete

### Security Fixes
- Commit b23d228: "fix: resolve security vulnerability GHSA-fv92-fjc5-jj9h in mapstructure"
- Commit 78b53ec: "fix: resolve security vulnerability GO-2025-3487 in golang.org/x/crypto"
- These security vulnerabilities have been resolved

### Blueprint Template Fixes
Based on recent commits, the following have been resolved:
- Session 5-12 template issues (multiple commits)
- Unused imports and variables in stdlib/chi templates
- Clean Architecture template compilation issues
- Microservice blueprint critical issues
- DDD Extended auth template issues
- gRPC Gateway blueprint implementation (commit 7687cb4)

### ORM Default Change
- Commit 0caca8d: Changed ORM default from GORM to empty string (raw database/sql)
- This was likely addressing a reported issue about defaults

### Banner System
- Commit 4140d44: Standardized banner usage across CLI with comprehensive configuration
- This feature is now fully implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Close ClickHouse Issues (#140, #141)**: Mark as "Won't Do" or move to a future milestone since ClickHouse support is not currently planned or implemented.

2. **Review Closed Issues**: Check if any recently closed issues were accidentally reopened or if there are other open issues not shown in the current query.

3. **Create New Issues**: For the remaining unimplemented features from the roadmap:
   - Event-driven blueprint (CQRS/Event Sourcing)
   - Monolith blueprint
   - Workspace blueprint (Go workspace/monorepo)
   - Lambda-proxy blueprint (API Gateway proxy)
   - Web UI implementation (Phase 3)
   - Advanced features (Phase 4)

## Summary

Based on the current state of the codebase:
- **3 issues can be closed** (ClickHouse-related: #140, #141 | Security: #34)
- **Multiple fixes have been implemented** that likely had corresponding issues already closed
- The project has successfully implemented 8 out of 12 planned blueprints
- Core functionality is production-ready with v1.1.0
- **Security framework is fully implemented** and ready for production use
