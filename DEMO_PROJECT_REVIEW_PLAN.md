## Issue Tracking

### Critical Issues Found

#### 1. ‚úÖ CLI Test Output Capture Issue (RESOLVED - Issue #78)
**Affected Projects**: cli-logrus, cli-slog, cli-zap, cli-zerolog
**Description**: Tests were failing because output was going to stdout but tests were trying to capture from cmd.SetOut()
**Impact**: All CLI project tests failed even though the actual CLI worked correctly
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Fixed by changing `fmt.Printf()` to `cmd.Printf()` in blueprint templates
**Resolution**: Committed in db4d9a5

#### 2. ‚úÖ Lambda Deprecated Runtime (RESOLVED - Issue #76)
**Affected Projects**: lambda-logrus, lambda-slog, lambda-zap, lambda-zerolog
**Description**: SAM templates used deprecated `Runtime: go1.x` which is no longer supported by AWS Lambda
**Impact**: Lambda functions could not be deployed to AWS
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Updated to `Runtime: provided.al2` and ensured binary is named "bootstrap"
**Resolution**: Committed in db4d9a5

#### 3. ‚úÖ Lambda Binary Naming Mismatch (RESOLVED - Issue #77)
**Affected Projects**: All Lambda projects
**Description**: Build scripts created binaries named after the project instead of "bootstrap"
**Impact**: Required custom runtime configuration instead of standard approach
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Standardized binary naming to "bootstrap" in Makefiles and deploy scripts
**Resolution**: Committed in db4d9a5

#### 4. ‚úÖ Integration Test Framework Mismatch (RESOLVED - Issue #79)
**Affected Projects**: std-echo-logrus, std-echo-slog, std-echo-zap, std-echo-zerolog, std-chi-logrus, std-chi-slog
**Description**: Integration test template hardcoded to use Gin framework regardless of selected framework
**Impact**: Integration tests fail to compile for Echo and Chi projects (6 out of 10 standard web API projects)
**Root Cause**: Blueprint template `tests/integration/api_test.go.tmpl` not conditional for different frameworks
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Fixed blueprint template with framework-conditional HTTP testing, including Fiber support
**Resolution**: Committed in 7bf6bd1, all 5 frameworks now supported

#### 5. ‚úÖ Demo Projects Generated with Outdated Templates (RESOLVED - Session 4 Regeneration)
**Affected Projects**: All 10 Session 4 projects (std-chi-zap, std-chi-zerolog, std-fiber-*, std-stdlib-*)
**Description**: Demo projects were generated before Issue #79 fix and still used buggy Gin-based integration tests
**Impact**: Session 4 review could not properly validate the current blueprint fixes
**Root Cause**: Demo projects generated with old template before framework-conditional fix
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Regenerated all affected demo projects with latest blueprint templates in `session4-regeneration/`
**Evidence**: All regenerated projects now use correct framework imports and pass integration tests
**Resolution**: All 10 projects regenerated and validated - all tests passing

#### 6. ‚úÖ Blueprint Template Compilation Issues (RESOLVED - Issue #80)
**Affected Projects**: All stdlib and chi framework projects
**Description**: Blueprint templates had unused imports (`strings`) and variables (`ctx`) causing compilation failures
**Impact**: Generated stdlib/chi projects failed `go build` and `go test` commands
**Root Cause**: Template conditionals were incorrect for stdlib imports and ctx variable handling
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Fixed blueprint template `blueprints/web-api-standard/cmd/server/main.go.tmpl` with proper conditionals
**Resolution**: Committed in 7a711ad, GitHub Issue #80 resolved, all future generated projects compile successfully

#### 7. ‚úÖ Microservice Blueprint Critical Issues (RESOLVED - Issues #42, #51, #69, #92)
**Affected Projects**: micro-logrus, micro-slog, micro-zap, micro-zerolog
**Description**: Microservice blueprint had multiple critical failures preventing functional gRPC microservice generation
**Impact**: 0% functional rate - projects compiled but could not serve gRPC requests or use selected loggers
**Root Cause**: Multiple template implementation gaps and outdated dependencies
**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- ‚úÖ Proto generation fixed (protoc-gen-go plugins integration + comprehensive installation guide)
- ‚úÖ gRPC server implementation complete (removed all TODO blocks, functional service registration)
- ‚úÖ Logger integration working (all 4 logger types: slog, zap, logrus, zerolog)
- ‚úÖ Service discovery integration functional (Consul/Kubernetes support)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies updated (gRPC v1.73.0, protobuf v1.36.6)
- ‚úÖ Build pipeline complete (Makefile automation with proto generation)
- ‚úÖ Testing validated (grpcurl integration confirmed)
**Solution**: Complete template overhaul with functional implementations replacing placeholder code
**Resolution**: Committed in a945077, GitHub Issues #42, #51, #69, #92 resolved
**Status**: ‚úÖ 100% FUNCTIONAL RATE - All 4 projects now generate working gRPC microservices

#### 8. ‚úÖ Clean Architecture Blueprint Template Compilation Issues (RESOLVED - Issues #94, #95, #96, #97)
**Affected Projects**: All 10 Clean Architecture Core projects (Session 7)
**Description**: Clean Architecture blueprint had critical template compilation failures preventing successful project generation
**Impact**: 0% success rate across all framework/logger combinations - projects could not compile or run
**Root Cause**: Multiple template syntax errors, missing imports, and framework integration issues
**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå Missing import statements in auth controller
- ‚ùå Template syntax errors in domain entities
- ‚ùå Incorrect interface definitions in ports
- ‚ùå Router initialization broken across frameworks (Gin, Echo, Chi, Fiber)
- ‚ùå Container dependency injection issues
- ‚ùå Authentication middleware integration failures
- ‚ùå Broken unit and integration test templates
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive template fixes across all Clean Architecture blueprint files
**Resolution**: Committed in 3a7ac52, GitHub Issues #94-#97 resolved
**Status**: ‚úÖ 100% SUCCESS RATE - All 10 projects now compile, build, and pass tests successfully

#### 9. ‚úÖ Clean Architecture Extended Template Cross-File Dependency Issues (RESOLVED - Session 8)
**Affected Projects**: All 11 Clean Architecture Extended projects (Session 8)
**Description**: Clean Architecture blueprint had critical cross-file dependency issues between user.go and auth.go templates preventing successful compilation
**Impact**: 55% failure rate (6/11 projects) - database and authentication projects could not compile
**Root Cause**: Missing `containsAt` function dependency between user.go.tmpl and auth.go.tmpl templates
**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå Database projects: user.go called `containsAt()` but function only existed in auth.go template
- ‚ùå Auth projects: Missing user.go and repositories.go files due to conditional generation logic
- ‚ùå Cross-file dependencies: Function defined in auth.go but needed in user.go for email validation
- ‚ùå Conditional generation: Template conditions caused incomplete domain layer generation
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Moved `containsAt()` function from auth.go.tmpl to user.go.tmpl to resolve cross-file dependency
**Resolution**: Template fixes applied and embedded templates regenerated
**Status**: ‚úÖ 100% SUCCESS RATE - All 11 projects now compile, build, and pass tests successfully

#### 10. ‚úÖ DDD Blueprint Logger Interface Type Mismatch (RESOLVED - Session 9)
**Affected Projects**: All 10 DDD Core projects (Session 9) - Echo and Chi frameworks specifically
**Description**: DDD blueprint had logger interface type mismatches preventing successful compilation across non-Gin frameworks
**Impact**: 60% failure rate (6/10 projects) - Echo and Chi framework projects could not compile
**Root Cause**: Handler constructors expected `logger.Logger` interface but logger factory returned `*logger.Logger` pointer
**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå Echo handlers: `cannot use appLogger (variable of type *Logger) as Logger value`
- ‚ùå Chi handlers: Same type mismatch preventing handler initialization
- ‚ùå Fiber handlers: Same pattern would cause issues (proactively fixed)
- ‚ùå Stdlib handlers: Same pattern would cause issues (proactively fixed)
- ‚ùå Framework inconsistency: Only Gin worked because it was designed for pointer type
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Updated all non-Gin framework handlers to accept `*logger.Logger` (pointer) consistently
**Files Fixed**:
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/presentation/http/handlers/user_echo.go.tmpl`
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/presentation/http/handlers/user_chi.go.tmpl`
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/presentation/http/handlers/user_fiber.go.tmpl`
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/presentation/http/handlers/user_stdlib.go.tmpl`
**Resolution**: Template fixes applied and validated with sub-agent approach - all logger types (slog, zap, logrus, zerolog) working
**Status**: ‚úÖ 100% SUCCESS RATE - All 10 projects now compile, build, and pass tests successfully

#### 11. ‚úÖ DDD Blueprint Authentication Template Issues (RESOLVED - Session 10)
**Affected Projects**: All 10 DDD Extended projects (Session 10) - specifically JWT and OAuth2 authentication demos
**Description**: DDD auth templates had critical issues preventing proper user creation and email-based authentication
**Impact**: 100% failure rate for auth-enabled projects - JWT and OAuth2 demos could not compile
**Root Cause**: Authentication command handlers calling `NewUser(name, description)` but user entity requires `NewUser(name, email, description)`
**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå RegisterCommand missing email field in authentication
- ‚ùå Auth handlers: `not enough arguments in call to user.NewUser`
- ‚ùå Login using name instead of email (security concern)
- ‚ùå Password recovery using name instead of email
- ‚ùå No email validation in registration process
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive auth template overhaul with email-based authentication
**Files Fixed**:
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/application/auth/commands.go.tmpl` - Added email to RegisterCommand
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/application/auth/command_handlers.go.tmpl` - Updated NewUser calls with email
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/application/auth/dto.go.tmpl` - Added email to DTOs and requests
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/internal/presentation/http/handlers/auth_*.go.tmpl` - Updated all framework handlers
**Resolution**: Email-based authentication implemented across JWT and OAuth2 with proper validation and security
**Status**: ‚úÖ 100% SUCCESS RATE - All 10 projects now compile and implement modern email-based authentication

#### 12. ‚úÖ DDD & Full Stack Final Configuration Issues (RESOLVED - Session 11)
**Affected Projects**: All 8 DDD Final + Full Stack projects (Session 11)
**Description**: Multiple critical issues preventing full-stack configurations from compiling successfully
**Impact**: 87.5% failure rate (7/8 projects) - only full-mixed compiled successfully
**Root Cause**: Several template configuration and generation issues for complex full-stack setups
**Critical Issues**:
- ‚ùå DDD without database: Domain layer not generated when no database driver specified
- ‚ùå Full Stack handler routing: Auth handlers called as functions instead of methods
- ‚ùå Clean Architecture stdlib: Missing infrastructure adapters for standard library framework
- ‚ùå CQRS implementation: Missing query handlers in full-ddd configuration
- ‚ùå Auth service initialization: userRepo referenced but not defined in database-less configs
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive fixes across DDD and Full Stack templates
**Files Fixed**:
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/cmd/server/main.go.tmpl` - Fixed auth service conditional initialization
- `blueprints/web-api-ddd/template.yaml` - Removed database dependency for domain layer generation
- `blueprints/web-api-clean/internal/infrastructure/web/adapters/stdlib_adapter.go.tmpl` - Created missing stdlib adapter
- `blueprints/web-api-clean/template.yaml` - Added stdlib adapter file generation rules
- `blueprints/web-api-clean/internal/infrastructure/web/factory.go.tmpl` - Added stdlib factory support
**Resolution**: All template issues resolved with systematic testing of full-stack configurations
**Status**: ‚úÖ 100% SUCCESS RATE - All 8 projects now compile and support full-stack development

### Quality Issues Found  

#### 1. Inconsistent Test Coverage
**Affected Projects**: CLI projects
**Description**: Some tests were not run for all logger variants (zap, zerolog)co
**Impact**: Potential untested edge cases

#### 2. ‚úÖ Lambda Binary Naming Mismatch (RESOLVED - Issue #77) 
**Affected Projects**: All Lambda projects
**Description**: Build scripts created binaries named after the project (e.g., "lambda-logrus") instead of "bootstrap"
**Impact**: Required custom runtime configuration instead of standard approach
**Solution**: ‚úÖ Standardized binary naming to "bootstrap" across all Lambda blueprints
**Resolution**: Committed in db4d9a5

### Enhancement Opportunities

#### 1. Test Helper Functions
**Description**: CLI tests could benefit from shared test helper functions to reduce duplication
**Impact**: Better maintainability and consistency across tests

#### 2. Lambda Local Testing Support
**Description**: Add test events and local testing scripts for Lambda functions
**Impact**: Easier development and testing workflow
