#### Architecture Patterns Deep Dive
```
🏗️ Choosing the Right Go Architecture Pattern

After implementing Clean Architecture, DDD, and Hexagonal patterns in go-starter, here's my guidance on when to use each:

📊 STANDARD ARCHITECTURE
✅ Best for: MVPs, small teams, rapid development
✅ When: Straightforward business logic, time-to-market priority
❌ Avoid when: Complex domains, high testability needs

🎯 CLEAN ARCHITECTURE  
✅ Best for: Enterprise applications, long-term projects
✅ When: Complex business logic, need for testability
❌ Avoid when: Simple CRUD, very small teams

🧩 DOMAIN-DRIVEN DESIGN
✅ Best for: Complex business domains, event-driven systems
✅ When: Rich business rules, domain expert collaboration
❌ Avoid when: Technical problems, simple data processing

⚡ HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE
✅ Best for: Maximum testability, multiple interfaces
✅ When: Testing is critical, multiple adapters needed
❌ Avoid when: Simple requirements, small teams

The key insight: Architecture patterns aren't about "better" or "worse" - they're about fit for purpose.

What's your experience with these patterns in Go? Which has worked best for your use cases?

#### r/programming Architecture Discussion

Title: Progressive Disclosure in Developer Tools: Adapting to User Experience Level

I've been thinking a lot about UX in developer tools lately, especially after implementing what I call "progressive disclosure" in go-starter (a Go project generator).

## The Problem

Most developer tools fall into two camps:
1. **Beginner-friendly**: Simple interface, limited functionality
2. **Power-user focused**: Complex interface, full functionality

This creates a problem: beginners get overwhelmed by complex tools, while experts feel constrained by simple ones.

## Progressive Disclosure Solution

Instead of choosing one approach, what if tools could adapt?

In go-starter, the same command shows different interfaces:

```bash
# Basic mode (beginners)
go-starter new --help
# Shows 14 essential flags with friendly descriptions

# Advanced mode (experts)  
go-starter new --advanced --help
# Shows 18+ flags including database, auth, deployment options
```

The tool detects user intent and adapts:
- If you provide enough flags, it skips interactive prompts
- If you use complexity flags, it applies smart defaults
- Help text changes based on your chosen mode

## Implementation Insights

**Challenge 1**: How do you categorize flags?
**Solution**: Essential vs. advanced categorization based on 80/20 usage patterns

**Challenge 2**: How do you avoid duplicate interfaces?
**Solution**: Intelligent flag filtering and deduplication

**Challenge 3**: How do you maintain both interfaces?
**Solution**: Single source of truth with presentation layers

## Results

Early feedback shows:
- Beginners feel less overwhelmed (14 vs 18+ options)
- Experts appreciate full control when needed
- Same tool serves both audiences effectively

## Questions for Discussion

1. Have you encountered this problem in other developer tools?
2. What other approaches could solve the beginner vs. expert tension?
3. Are there downsides to adaptive interfaces you can think of?

I'm curious about your experiences with developer tool UX. What tools do this well? What tools frustrate you with their complexity (or lack thereof)?

Would love to hear your thoughts on this approach!

# Introducing go-starter: The Go Project Generator That Adapts to You

*TL;DR: go-starter is a comprehensive Go project generator that adapts its interface based on your experience level, supports multiple architecture patterns, and reduces logging code by 60-90%.*

## The Problem with Current Project Generators

As a Go developer, you've probably faced this dilemma: existing project generators are either too simple (limiting your options) or too complex (overwhelming beginners). Most tools force you to choose between beginner-friendly simplicity and expert-level functionality.

What if there was a better way?

## Meet go-starter: Progressive Disclosure in Action

go-starter solves this with **progressive disclosure** - the same tool that adapts its interface based on your experience level and needs.

### For Beginners: Clean and Simple
```bash
go-starter new --help
```
Shows 14 essential options with beginner-friendly descriptions. No overwhelming choices, just what you need to get started.

### For Experts: Full Control
```bash
go-starter new --advanced --help
```
Reveals 18+ advanced options including database drivers, authentication types, deployment configurations, and architectural patterns.

### Smart Adaptation
The tool automatically adapts based on your usage:
- Provide enough flags? Skips interactive prompts
- Use complexity settings? Applies intelligent defaults
- Choose advanced mode? Unlocks all features

## Multiple Architecture Patterns

go-starter doesn't just generate code - it generates **well-architected** code:

### Standard Architecture
Perfect for most projects and rapid development:
```bash
go-starter new my-api --type=web-api
```

### Clean Architecture
For enterprise applications requiring high testability:
```bash
go-starter new my-api --type=web-api --architecture=clean
```

### Domain-Driven Design
For complex business domains:
```bash
go-starter new my-api --type=web-api --architecture=ddd
```

### Hexagonal Architecture
For maximum testability and multiple adapters:
```bash
go-starter new my-api --type=web-api --architecture=hexagonal
```

Each pattern includes proper separation of concerns, testing infrastructure, and security best practices.

## Simplified Logging System: 60-90% Less Code

One of go-starter's most innovative features is its unified logging interface. Instead of writing different code for different loggers, you write once and switch loggers with a single flag.

### Traditional Approach (Different APIs)
```go
// With zap
logger.Info("User created", zap.String("user_id", userID), zap.String("email", email))

// With logrus  
logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{"user_id": userID, "email": email}).Info("User created")

// With zerolog
logger.Info().Str("user_id", userID).Str("email", email).Msg("User created")
```

### go-starter Approach (Unified API)
```go
// Works with any logger
logger.Info("User created", "user_id", userID, "email", email)
```

Switch loggers without changing code:
```bash
# High performance
go-starter new my-api --logger=zap

# Zero allocation
go-starter new my-api --logger=zerolog

# Standard library
go-starter new my-api --logger=slog
```

## ATDD Infrastructure: Production-Ready Quality

go-starter includes comprehensive testing infrastructure:

- **Automated Test Generation**: Creates tests from blueprint analysis
- **Continuous Coverage Monitoring**: Real-time quality gates
- **Self-Maintaining Infrastructure**: Autonomous test optimization
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Tracks and alerts on performance changes
