# Task Master Guide for Go Project Generator Development

## Overview

[Task Master](https://www.task-master.dev/) is an AI-powered project management tool specifically designed for AI agents and complex software development workflows. This guide explains how to leverage Task Master to better organize the development of our Go project generator (go-starter).

## What is Task Master?

Task Master is a free, open-source tool that helps break down complex software projects into manageable tasks that AI agents can handle efficiently. It addresses "context overload" by providing structured task decomposition and workflow management.

### Key Features
- **AI-optimized task breakdown**: Converts complex projects into "one-shot" tasks for AI agents
- **Context management**: Prevents information overload during development
- **Open source**: Completely free with bring-your-own API keys
- **Development-focused**: Built specifically for software development workflows

## How Task Master Can Help Our Go Project Generator

### 1. Complex Feature Development

**Problem**: Large features like "Add Bun ORM support" involve multiple interconnected tasks that can overwhelm development sessions.

**Task Master Solution**:
```
Project: Bun ORM Integration
├── Research Phase
│   ├── Analyze current ORM implementation patterns
│   ├── Study Bun ORM API and best practices
│   └── Identify integration points in codebase
├── Test Development (TDD/ATDD)
│   ├── Write acceptance tests for project generation
│   ├── Write unit tests for ORM selection logic
│   ├── Write integration tests for blueprint rendering
│   └── Write performance tests for generated code
├── Implementation Phase
│   ├── Add Bun to ORM options in prompts
│   ├── Create Bun-specific template files
│   ├── Update blueprint configurations
│   └── Implement conditional generation logic
└── Validation Phase
    ├── Test generated projects compile successfully
    ├── Validate all architecture patterns work
    └── Run full test suite
```

### 2. Multi-Architecture Blueprint Creation

**Problem**: Creating blueprint templates for all 4 architectures (Standard, Clean, DDD, Hexagonal) requires consistent implementation across multiple files.

**Task Master Solution**:
```
Project: Bun Router Blueprint Templates
├── Core Templates
│   ├── Create shared router configuration template
│   ├── Create shared middleware templates
│   ├── Create shared handler base templates
│   └── Create shared error handling templates
├── Standard Architecture
│   ├── Create direct router usage templates
│   ├── Create simple handler implementations
│   └── Create basic service integration
├── Clean Architecture
│   ├── Create infrastructure layer router templates
│   ├── Create interface definitions
│   └── Create use case integrations
├── DDD Architecture
│   ├── Create application service router templates
│   ├── Create domain model mappings
│   └── Create command/query handlers
└── Hexagonal Architecture
    ├── Create driving adapter templates
    ├── Create port definitions
    └── Create adapter implementations
```

### 3. Full-Stack Integration Development

**Problem**: Integrating Bun ORM + Bun Router requires coordination across multiple components and careful testing.

**Task Master Solution**:
```
Project: Bun Full-Stack Integration
├── Architecture Analysis
│   ├── Map integration points between ORM and Router
│   ├── Design shared configuration system
│   ├── Plan unified error handling strategy
│   └── Design type-safe request/response flow
├── Shared Infrastructure
│   ├── Create unified configuration templates
│   ├── Implement transaction middleware
│   ├── Create shared error handling utilities
│   └── Implement type conversion helpers
├── Integration Testing
│   ├── Test complete request-to-database flows
│   ├── Test transaction rollback scenarios
│   ├── Test error propagation patterns
│   └── Performance benchmark full-stack vs mixed
└── Documentation
    ├── Create integration examples
    ├── Document best practices
    ├── Create migration guides
    └── Add troubleshooting section
```

## Implementation Strategy with Task Master

### Phase 1: Project Setup

1. **Install Task Master** (following their documentation)
2. **Create Project Hierarchy**:
   ```
   go-starter-development/
   ├── bun-orm-integration/
   ├── bun-router-integration/
   ├── full-stack-integration/
   ├── testing-improvements/
   └── documentation-updates/
   ```

3. **Define Task Templates** for common development patterns:
   - Feature development template
   - Testing template (TDD/ATDD)
   - Blueprint creation template
   - Documentation template

### Phase 2: Task Decomposition

For each GitHub issue, create a Task Master project that breaks it down into actionable subtasks:

#### Example: Issue #121 (Bun ORM Integration)

```yaml
# Task Master Project Configuration
project_name: "Bun ORM Integration"
github_issue: "#121"
priority: "high"
estimated_duration: "2-3 days"

tasks:
  - name: "Research current ORM patterns"
    type: "research"
    duration: "2 hours"
    dependencies: []
    
  - name: "Write acceptance tests"
    type: "testing"
    duration: "4 hours"
    dependencies: ["Research current ORM patterns"]
    
  - name: "Write unit tests"
    type: "testing"
    duration: "3 hours"
    dependencies: ["Research current ORM patterns"]
    
  - name: "Implement prompt integration"
    type: "implementation"
    duration: "2 hours"
    dependencies: ["Write unit tests"]
    
  - name: "Create blueprint templates"
    type: "implementation"
    duration: "6 hours"
    dependencies: ["Write acceptance tests"]
    
  - name: "Validate implementation"
    type: "validation"
    duration: "2 hours"
    dependencies: ["Implement prompt integration", "Create blueprint templates"]
```

### Phase 3: AI Agent Workflow Optimization

**Context Management**: Each task should be small enough for an AI agent to complete in a single session without losing context.

**Ideal Task Size**:
- **Research tasks**: 1-2 hours, focused on specific components
- **Test tasks**: 2-4 hours, covering specific functionality
- **Implementation tasks**: 2-6 hours, focused on single feature area
- **Validation tasks**: 1-3 hours, testing specific integration points

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking and Dependencies

Task Master can help track:
- **Blocked tasks**: What's waiting on other work
- **Ready tasks**: What can be started immediately
- **In-progress tasks**: Current development focus
- **Completed tasks**: Progress tracking

## Benefits for Our Development Workflow

### 1. Reduced Context Switching
- Each task is self-contained with clear objectives
- Dependencies are explicit and manageable
- Focus remains on single functional area

### 2. Better TDD/ATDD Implementation
- Test tasks are clearly separated from implementation
- Ensures tests are written before code
- Validation steps are explicit and measurable

### 3. Improved Code Quality
- Smaller, focused changes are easier to review
- Each task has clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies prevent rushing ahead without proper foundation

### 4. Enhanced Collaboration
- Tasks can be distributed among team members or AI agents
- Progress is visible and measurable
- Blocked work is identified quickly

### 5. Predictable Development Velocity
- Task estimation improves over time
- Bottlenecks are identified early
- Work can be planned more accurately

## Integration with Existing Tools

### GitHub Issues
- Link Task Master projects to GitHub issues
- Use Task Master for detailed task breakdown
- GitHub issues remain high-level feature tracking

### Testing Framework
- Task Master ensures test-first development
- Each implementation task has corresponding test tasks
- Validation tasks verify test coverage and functionality

### Documentation
- Documentation tasks are explicit in project plans
- Examples and guides are planned alongside features
- Knowledge transfer is built into the workflow

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Granularity
- **Too large**: "Implement Bun ORM support" (8+ hours)
- **Just right**: "Create Bun model templates for standard architecture" (2-3 hours)
- **Too small**: "Add import statement for Bun" (15 minutes)

### 2. Dependency Management
- Map dependencies clearly before starting
- Ensure all prerequisites are completed
- Block tasks that can't proceed without dependencies

### 3. Testing Integration
- Always pair implementation tasks with test tasks
- Ensure acceptance tests are completed before implementation
- Validate implementation against tests before marking complete

### 4. Documentation Discipline
- Include documentation tasks in every project
- Update guides and examples as features are implemented
- Ensure examples are tested and working

## Example Workflow

### Starting a New Feature (Bun Router Integration)

1. **Create Task Master Project**: "Bun Router Integration"
2. **Break Down into Phases**:
   - Research (understand current router patterns)
   - Testing (write comprehensive tests first)
   - Implementation (create templates and logic)
   - Integration (ensure works with all architectures)
   - Documentation (guides and examples)

3. **Define Dependencies**:
   - Testing depends on Research
   - Implementation depends on Testing
   - Integration depends on Implementation
   - Documentation depends on Integration

4. **Execute Tasks in Order**:
   - Focus on one task at a time
   - Complete dependencies before proceeding
   - Validate each task before moving forward

5. **Track Progress**:
   - Mark tasks complete only when fully done
   - Update dependencies as work progresses
   - Identify and resolve blockers quickly

## Conclusion

Task Master provides a structured approach to managing the complexity of our Go project generator development. By breaking down large features into manageable, AI-agent-friendly tasks, we can:

- Maintain focus and reduce context overload
- Ensure proper TDD/ATDD implementation
- Improve code quality through smaller, focused changes
- Track progress more effectively
- Scale development with multiple contributors

The tool's AI-first design makes it particularly well-suited for our development workflow, where AI agents handle much of the implementation work while maintaining high quality standards through structured task management.
