# TDD Enforcement Strategy for go-starter

This document outlines the comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) enforcement strategy implemented for the go-starter project to ensure all feature development follows strict TDD principles.

## 🎯 Enforcement Overview

### Mandatory TDD for All Development

**Every feature development item in the GitHub issues backlog now requires TDD compliance.** This is enforced through:

1. **Issue Templates** - TDD requirements built into issue creation
2. **Pull Request Templates** - TDD verification required for PR approval
3. **CI/CD Automation** - Automated testing and coverage enforcement
4. **Documentation** - Clear guidelines and examples for TDD compliance

## 📋 Issue Template Enforcement

### 1. Enhanced Feature Request Template

**File**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`

**New TDD Requirements Added**:
- **Test Plan Section** (Required): Forces contributors to plan testing approach before coding
- **TDD Commitment Checkboxes** (Required): Explicit commitment to Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Acceptance Criteria** (Required): Testable criteria with coverage goals
- **Coverage Requirements**: >70% for new code, maintained project coverage

**Key Sections**:
```yaml
- type: textarea
  id: test-plan
  attributes:
    label: Test Plan
    description: |
      Describe your testing approach for this feature. Include:
      - What unit tests will be needed
      - What integration tests will be needed  
      - Expected test coverage goals
      - Any edge cases to test
  validations:
    required: true

- type: checkboxes
  id: tdd-commitment
  attributes:
    label: TDD Development Commitment
    options:
      - label: I will write tests BEFORE implementing the feature (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
        required: true
      - label: I will ensure all new code has comprehensive test coverage (>70%)
        required: true
```

### 2. New Development Task Template

**File**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/development_task.yml`

**Purpose**: Internal development tasks with strict TDD enforcement

**Key Features**:
- **Test-First Development Plan**: Detailed Red-Green-Refactor planning
- **Coverage Requirements**: Specific coverage goals and strategies
- **Definition of Done**: Quality gates that must be met
- **TDD Enforcement Commitment**: Multiple levels of TDD compliance confirmation

**Structure**:
- Task description and requirements
- Mandatory TDD implementation plan
- Test coverage requirements (>70% for new code)
- Acceptance criteria with quality gates
- Files to modify/create tracking
- Multiple TDD compliance confirmations

## 🔍 Pull Request Template Enforcement

**File**: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

**New TDD Verification Sections**:

### 1. TDD Implementation Evidence
- **Red Phase**: Commit hash showing failing tests written first
- **Green Phase**: Commit hash showing minimal implementation
- **Refactor Phase**: Commit hash showing quality improvements

### 2. Test Coverage Analysis
- **New Code Coverage**: >70% line coverage requirement
- **Overall Project Coverage**: No reduction allowed
- **Branch Coverage**: >80% for critical paths
- **Error Path Coverage**: 100% for error handling

### 3. Test Quality Verification
- **Unit Tests**: All functions/methods tested
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions tested
- **Error Scenarios**: All error paths tested
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Multiple scenarios efficiently tested

### 4. TDD Compliance Declaration
- Explicit confirmation of TDD principles followed
- Understanding that PRs will be rejected without TDD compliance

## 🤖 Automated CI/CD Enforcement

**File**: `.github/workflows/tdd-enforcement.yml`

**Automated Checks**:

### 1. TDD Compliance Check
- Code quality verification (golangci-lint, go vet)
- Go module verification
- Basic compliance checks

### 2. Test Coverage Analysis
- **Minimum Coverage**: 30% overall project, 70% for new code
- **Missing Test Detection**: Identifies Go files without corresponding tests
- **Coverage Reporting**: Automatic PR comments with coverage details

### 3. Test Quality Verification
- **Verbose Test Execution**: Ensures all tests pass
- **Race Detection**: Tests with race condition detection
- **Naming Conventions**: Verifies proper test function naming
- **Table-Driven Pattern**: Encourages comprehensive test patterns

### 4. Integration Test Verification
- **Template Generation**: Tests CLI tool functionality
- **Build Verification**: Ensures generated projects compile

### 5. Enforcement Summary
- **Gate for Merging**: Fails CI if TDD requirements not met
- **Detailed Reporting**: Clear summary of what passed/failed

**Key Features**:
```yaml
env:
  GO_VERSION: "1.21"
  MIN_COVERAGE: 70.0
  MIN_PROJECT_COVERAGE: 30.0

- name: Check minimum project coverage
  run: |
    COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep "total:" | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $MIN_PROJECT_COVERAGE" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "❌ Project coverage ${COVERAGE}% is below minimum ${MIN_PROJECT_COVERAGE}%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## 📚 Documentation Enforcement

### 1. Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md

**File**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Content**:
- **TDD is Mandatory**: Clear statement that TDD is required
- **Red-Green-Refactor Explanation**: Detailed process explanation
- **Step-by-Step Workflow**: How to follow TDD in practice
- **Code Examples**: Good vs bad testing practices
- **Coverage Requirements**: Specific coverage thresholds
- **Common Violations**: What will be rejected
- **Project-Specific Guidelines**: Template, generator, and CLI testing

### 2. TDD Enforcement Documentation

**File**: `docs/TDD-ENFORCEMENT.md` (this document)

**Purpose**: Central reference for TDD enforcement strategy

## 🎯 Coverage Requirements

### Project-Level Requirements
- **Overall Project Coverage**: Must maintain >30%
- **New Code Coverage**: Must achieve >70%
