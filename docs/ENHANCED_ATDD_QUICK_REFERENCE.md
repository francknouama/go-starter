```

## 🧪 Test Suites Explained

| Suite | What It Tests | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **compilation** 🔨 | Generated projects compile successfully | Ensures your generated code actually works |
| **imports** 📦 | No unused imports in generated code | Keeps code clean and follows Go best practices |
| **variables** 🔤 | No unused variables in generated code | Prevents common Go compilation warnings |
| **configuration** ⚙️ | Dependencies match selected options | Ensures go.mod and configs are consistent |
| **framework-isolation** 🚧 | No framework cross-contamination | Prevents gin imports in fiber projects, etc. |

## ⚡ Performance Features

### Intelligent Caching (60% Faster!)
- **Before**: Every test generated a new project → 31.4 seconds
- **After**: Identical projects are cached and reused → 12.5 seconds
- **Result**: Same comprehensive testing, much faster execution

### Parallel Execution
- **5 test suites run simultaneously**
- **Each suite targets different quality aspects**
- **Fail-fast disabled**: You get feedback from ALL suites even if one fails

## 🛠️ Running Tests Locally

### Run All Enhanced Quality Tests
```bash
cd tests/acceptance/enhanced/quality
go test -v . -timeout 15m
```

### Run Specific Test Suite
```bash
# Test compilation only
go test -v . -timeout 10m -run "TestQualityFeatures.*compile.*successfully"

# Test imports only  
go test -v . -timeout 8m -run "TestQualityFeatures.*unused.*imports"

# Test variables only
go test -v . -timeout 8m -run "TestQualityFeatures.*unused.*variables"

# Test configuration only
go test -v . -timeout 8m -run "TestQualityFeatures.*Configuration.*consistent"

# Test framework isolation only
go test -v . -timeout 8m -run "TestQualityFeatures.*framework.*cross.*contamination"
```

### Build and Test CLI
```bash
# Build the CLI first
make build

# Then run tests
cd tests/acceptance/enhanced/quality
go test -v . -timeout 15m
```

## 🚨 When Tests Fail

### 1. Check the PR Comment
- Look for ❌ symbols in the quality report
- Check which specific suite failed
- Review the failure details

### 2. Download Detailed Reports
- GitHub Actions stores detailed reports as artifacts
- Look for `quality-test-report-[suite-name]` artifacts
- Download and review for specific failure information

### 3. Common Failure Types

#### Compilation Failures 🔨
```
❌ compilation: Generated project doesn't compile
```
**Fix**: Check template files for syntax errors, missing imports, or invalid Go code

#### Import Issues 📦
```
❌ imports: Unused imports detected
```
**Fix**: Remove unused imports from template files, check conditional generation logic

#### Variable Issues 🔤
```
❌ variables: Unused variables found
```
**Fix**: Remove unused variables or use them appropriately in templates

#### Configuration Issues ⚙️
```
❌ configuration: Dependencies don't match selections
```
**Fix**: Ensure go.mod templates include correct dependencies for selected features

#### Framework Isolation Issues 🚧
```
❌ framework-isolation: Found gin imports in fiber project
```
**Fix**: Check template conditional logic to prevent framework cross-contamination

### 4. Reproduce Locally
```bash
# Generate a project with the same configuration that's failing
./bin/go-starter new test-project --type=web-api --framework=gin --logger=slog

# Test the generated project
cd test-project
go mod tidy
go build ./...
```

## 🔍 Understanding Performance

### Cache Hit Indicators
- **First run**: Longer execution as projects are generated
- **Subsequent runs**: Faster execution due to caching
- **Cache key**: Based on project configuration (framework, logger, database, etc.)

### Execution Time Guidelines
| Suite | Expected Time | With Cache | Without Cache |
|-------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| compilation | < 10 minutes | < 5 minutes | < 15 minutes |
| imports | < 8 minutes | < 3 minutes | < 10 minutes |
| variables | < 8 minutes | < 3 minutes | < 10 minutes |
| configuration | < 8 minutes | < 3 minutes | < 10 minutes |
| framework-isolation | < 8 minutes | < 3 minutes | < 10 minutes |

## 📊 Quality Metrics

### Success Rate Targets
- **Per Suite**: > 95% success rate
- **Overall**: > 98% success rate
- **Performance**: < 15 seconds average per suite

### What Counts as Success
- ✅ **Passed Test**: Generated code meets quality criteria
- ❌ **Failed Test**: Quality issue detected (fix required)
- ⏭️ **Skipped Test**: Test not applicable (configuration dependent)

## 🛡️ Quality Gates

### PR Quality Gates
Your PR must pass ALL of these to merge:
1. ✅ Unit tests pass
2. ✅ Code linting passes
3. ✅ Template validation passes
4. ✅ Standard ATDD tests pass
5. ✅ Enhanced quality tests pass (all 5 suites)

### Quality Gate Failure
If the quality gate fails:
1. **PR cannot be merged** (protected branches)
2. **Detailed report shows exactly what failed**
3. **Fix the issues and push again**
4. **Tests will re-run automatically**

## 🔧 Developer Workflow

### Before Pushing
```bash
# 1. Build your changes
make build

# 2. Run tests locally
cd tests/acceptance/enhanced/quality
go test -v . -timeout 15m

# 3. If tests pass, push your changes
git push origin feature-branch
```

### After Pushing
1. **Wait for CI to complete** (~5-10 minutes with parallel execution)
2. **Check PR comment for quality report**
3. **If failures occur, fix and push again**
4. **When all green, request review**

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Optimize Your Development
1. **Test locally first** - saves CI time and faster feedback
2. **Use caching** - identical project configs run faster
3. **Fix quality issues early** - easier than debugging later
4. **Understand suite purposes** - target your fixes appropriately

### Performance Optimization
1. **Template changes** affect compilation suite most
2. **Import/variable issues** often stem from conditional logic
3. **Configuration problems** usually in go.mod templates
4. **Framework isolation** requires careful template design

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Start with compilation** - if it doesn't compile, other tests will fail too
2. **Check generated projects** manually with `--dry-run` flag
3. **Use local generation** to reproduce issues quickly
4. **Review template logic** for conditional generation bugs
