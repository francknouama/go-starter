## üîÑ Integration with Existing CLI Codebase

### **Code Reuse Strategy**
- [ ] **Template Engine:** Reuse existing template processing logic
- [ ] **Generator Service:** Adapt CLI generator for web context
- [ ] **Logger Factory:** Use same logger selection system
- [ ] **Validation:** Reuse project name and module path validation

### **Shared Components**
```go
// Shared packages between CLI and Web
pkg/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/    // Template definitions and processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generator/    // Core generation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validator/    // Input validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger/       // Logger factory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/        // Shared data structures

// Web-specific packages
web/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/          // HTTP handlers and middleware  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/         // Authentication and authorization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/       // Database models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/     // Business logic services
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ websocket/    // Real-time communication
```

### **API-CLI Compatibility**
- [ ] Maintain feature parity between CLI and web versions
- [ ] Same template outputs regardless of generation method
- [ ] Shared configuration format and validation rules
- [ ] Version compatibility between CLI and web API

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
1. **Performance at Scale**
   - **Risk:** Project generation slowdown with concurrent users
   - **Mitigation:** Queue system, horizontal scaling, caching

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - **Risk:** Code injection, unauthorized access
   - **Mitigation:** Input sanitization, security audits, rate limiting

### **Business Risks**
1. **Low User Adoption**
   - **Risk:** Market doesn't value web-based Go generation
   - **Mitigation:** Strong CLI user base, clear value proposition

2. **Pricing Model Rejection**
   - **Risk:** Users prefer free CLI tool over paid SaaS
   - **Mitigation:** Generous free tier, clear premium value

### **Operational Risks**
1. **Development Timeline**
   - **Risk:** 6-week timeline may be aggressive
   - **Mitigation:** MVP focus, parallel development with templates

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - **Risk:** Full-stack development requires diverse skills
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on core features first, gradual expansion
