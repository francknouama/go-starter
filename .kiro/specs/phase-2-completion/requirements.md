# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes Phase 2 of the go-starter project by implementing the remaining 4 blueprint templates to achieve 100% Phase 2 completion. The go-starter project is a comprehensive Go project generator that provides production-ready blueprint templates for various architectural patterns. Currently at 77% completion (10/13 blueprints), this feature will implement the final 4 blueprints: monolith (finish remaining 2%), lambda-proxy, workspace, and event-driven architectures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Monolith Blueprint

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete monolith blueprint template, so that I can generate traditional web applications with all necessary components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer generates a monolith project THEN the system SHALL provide complete middleware components (auth.go, cors.go, logger.go, recovery.go)
2. WHEN a developer generates a monolith project THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test suites (integration_test.go, helpers.go)
3. WHEN a developer generates a monolith project THEN the system SHALL provide development scripts (setup.sh, migrate.sh)
4. WHEN a developer generates a monolith project THEN the system SHALL achieve >8.5/10 quality score
5. WHEN a developer generates a monolith project THEN the system SHALL provide OWASP Top 10 compliance
6. WHEN a developer generates a monolith project THEN the system SHALL provide <200ms page load performance

### Requirement 2: Implement Lambda-Proxy Blueprint

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a lambda-proxy blueprint template, so that I can generate serverless REST APIs with API Gateway integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL provide API Gateway proxy handler with request/response transformation
2. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful routing with path and query parameter processing
3. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL provide JWT authentication with API Gateway custom authorizers
4. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL provide AWS SDK v2 integration (DynamoDB, S3, SES, CloudWatch)
5. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL provide Infrastructure as Code templates (Terraform, Serverless, SAM)
6. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL achieve <500ms cold start time
7. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL achieve <100ms execution time
8. WHEN a developer generates a lambda-proxy project THEN the system SHALL achieve >8.5/10 quality score

### Requirement 3: Implement Workspace Blueprint

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a workspace blueprint template, so that I can generate Go multi-module monorepo projects with proper dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL provide Go workspace configuration (go.work, go.work.sum)
2. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL provide multi-module structure (cmd/, pkg/, internal/, services/)
3. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL provide build orchestration with parallel builds
4. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL provide automated documentation generation
5. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL provide multi-module CI/CD pipeline
6. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL achieve <5min full build time
7. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL achieve >85% test coverage
8. WHEN a developer generates a workspace project THEN the system SHALL achieve >8.0/10 quality score

### Requirement 4: Implement Event-Driven Blueprint

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an event-driven blueprint template, so that I can generate CQRS/Event Sourcing architecture applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL provide event store abstraction with multiple implementations (memory, PostgreSQL)
2. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL provide CQRS implementation with command/query separation
3. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL provide domain-driven design with aggregate pattern
4. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL provide message bus abstraction with multiple transports (NATS, Kafka, Redis)
5. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL provide saga pattern for distributed transactions
6. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL provide API layer with REST and GraphQL interfaces
7. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL achieve <10ms command processing time
8. WHEN a developer generates an event-driven project THEN the system SHALL achieve >8.5/10 quality score

### Requirement 5: Blueprint Integration and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all blueprints to integrate seamlessly with the existing system, so that I have a consistent and reliable project generation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all blueprints are implemented THEN the system SHALL register all 4 new blueprints in the template registry
2. WHEN all blueprints are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage (>80% for each blueprint)
3. WHEN all blueprints are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide complete documentation for each blueprint
4. WHEN all blueprints are implemented THEN the system SHALL pass all security vulnerability scans
5. WHEN all blueprints are implemented THEN the system SHALL achieve 100% Phase 2 completion (13/13 blueprints)
6. WHEN a developer lists available blueprints THEN the system SHALL display all 13 blueprints with accurate descriptions
